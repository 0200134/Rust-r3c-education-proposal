# 🦀 Rust R3C Education Proposal  
### *Teaching the LLVM-free Rust ecosystem.*

> “From compiler theory to sustainable design — learning Rust 3.0, not just using it.”

---

## 🧭 Overview
**Rust-R3C-Education-Proposal** is an open proposal  
for building a modern Rust education framework  
based on the **R3C / LLVM-Zero / Beyond-LLVM** ecosystem.

It aims to transform compiler theory into teachable, practical content  
for developers, students, and researchers who want to understand  
how Rust can evolve beyond LLVM.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Introduce **Rust 3.0 (R3C)** philosophy and design.  
- Explain the **LLVM-Zero** ecosystem in educational terms.  
- Build lesson structures for universities and independent learners.  
- Create a **curriculum blueprint** for compiler and systems education.  
- Encourage **open collaboration** between educators and engineers.

## 🧱 Curriculum Outline
| Module | Title | Focus |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Introduction to Rust | Language basics and safe systems programming |
| 2 | R3C Concept | Self-hosting, LLVM-free compilation model |
| 3 | LLVM-Zero Ecosystem | Cross-layer compiler independence |
| 4 | Beyond-LLVM | Post-compiler design and sustainability |
| 5 | Project-Based Learning | Building a minimal Rust toolchain prototype |

---

## 🪶 Philosophy
> “Education should not just teach syntax —  
> it should reveal how languages think.”

This proposal treats **Rust as a living ecosystem** —  
a language that can explain itself.

## 🧭 Roadmap
| Phase | Goal |
|-------|------|
| Phase 1 | Write core lessons and diagrams |
| Phase 2 | Prepare PDF / slide version for open courses |
| Phase 3 | Pilot open curriculum with contributors |
| Phase 4 | Integrate with LLVM-Zero documentation hub |
